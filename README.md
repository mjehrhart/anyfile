I needed an easier method to store screenshots and .gifs for github docs: readme, issues, discussions, etc...

I was tired of opening the github web page to upload a new screenshot so I created this little app.  Here you can drag files onto the app and the app will 
upload the file to your repository for you. You can view the file, click on the file to obtain a http img tag and you can even remove files from your repo.

This app is free to use and is a work in progress. No information is collected at all (it's open source)
